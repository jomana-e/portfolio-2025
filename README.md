# 🧠 Data Science & AI Portfolio — 2025

Welcome to my personal **Data Science and AI portfolio** — a collection of 10 compact, high-impact projects that demonstrate practical skills in **machine learning**, **data analysis**, **AI applications**, and **deployment**.

Each project is designed to be **end-to-end**: from raw data → model → interactive app → clean documentation.
